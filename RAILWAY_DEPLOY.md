### 3. Set Up Lavalink Service

Railway needs TWO services: **Bot** + **Lavalink Server**

#### Add Lavalink Service:
1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Empty Service"**
3. Name it `lavalink`
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Source** ‚Üí **Docker Image**
5. Use image: `ghcr.io/lavalink-devs/lavalink:4.0.8`
6. In **Variables**, add:
   ```
   SERVER_PORT=2333
   LAVALINK_SERVER_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass
   ```
7. Click **Deploy**

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

In your **Bot service**, add these variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `TOKEN` | `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token |
| `CLIENT_ID` | `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` | Bot application ID |
| `GUILD_ID` | `YOUR_GUILD_ID` | Your Discord server ID (optional) |
| `LAVALINK_HOST` | `lavalink.railway.internal` | Lavalink internal hostname |
| `LAVALINK_PORT` | `2333` | Lavalink port |
| `LAVALINK_PASSWORD` | `youshallnotpass` | Lavalink password |

**How to add variables:**
1. Go to your bot service
2. Click **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"+ New Variable"**
4. Add each variable from the table above

### 5. Deploy Commands to Discord

After the bot starts, you need to register slash commands:

**Option 1: Using Railway CLI**
```bash
railway run node src/deploy-commands.js
```

**Option 2: Temporary local deployment**
1. Copy your Railway environment variables to local `.env`
2. Run: `node src/deploy-commands.js --scope=guild`
3. Commands will be registered globally

### 6. Start the Bot

Once both services are running:
1. Check **Deployments** tab for any errors
2. View **Logs** to confirm bot is connected
3. Look for: `‚úÖ Logged in as Nabra#7511`
4. Invite bot to your server and test `/play`

## üîß Configuration Files

### `railway.json`

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

Railway pricing (as of 2025):
- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month
- **Bot service**: ~$2-3/month
- **Lavalink service**: ~$2-3/month
- **Total**: ~$4-6/month (fits in free tier for small bots)

If you exceed $5/month, you'll need to add a payment method.

```bash
# View bot logs
railway logs

# View Lavalink logs
railway logs --service lavalink
```

### Check Status

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bot not connecting to Lavalink
- Check `LAVALINK_HOST` is set to `lavalink.railway.internal`
- Verify Lavalink service is running (green status)
- Check Lavalink logs for errors

### Commands not showing in Discord
- Run `node src/deploy-commands.js` to register commands
- Wait 1-5 minutes for Discord to update
- Try in a different server or DM the bot

### Bot keeps restarting

- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure you have valid Discord token

### Out of credits
